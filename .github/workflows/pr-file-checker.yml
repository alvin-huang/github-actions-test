# The outline of this workflow is something that the GitHub Security team warns against
# here: https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests. But
# due to this workflow only running a git diff check and not building or publishing anything,
# there is no harm in checking out the PR HEAD code.
#
# All the code checked out in this workflow should be considered untrusted. This workflow must
# never call any makefiles or scripts. It must never be changed to run any code from the checkout.
